# VAT Rates

_Up-to-date European VAT Rates_

As of 1 January 2015 new EU VAT regulations change the way in which VAT (consumer tax) is charged on digital services. Instead of the tax rate being applied according to where the supplier is located, the seller must determine where the buyer is located and apply the relevant local rate of tax to the purchaser.

See: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/telecom

This repository provides files in different formats (Javascript, JSON & PHP) to help you apply these local VAT rates.

## Updates

VAT rates are updated using data provided by the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf) and [VATLive.com](http://www.vatlive.com).
